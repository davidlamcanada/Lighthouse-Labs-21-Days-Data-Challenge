# Lighthouse-Labs-21-Days-Data-Challenge

Here are the 21-day data (Python) challenge questions! I posted them here so I can practice them in the future. I also kept the story plot to keeps the content exciting as if I was doing the challenge again.

We are traveling with Dot around the world and applying our data skills to everyday scenarios.
